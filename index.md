Hi there, my name is Veronica Berglyd Olsen, and welcome to my personal website!

I'm a scientist by training, programmer by profession, and a writer in-between. I grew up on the South-Western coast of Norway, but
I've also lived in Sydney, Australia for two years, and on the French side of the Geneva valley on the Swiss-French border for about
four. I currently live in Oslo, Norway.

I have a Ph.D. in physics – or more precisely, in Plasma Wakefield Accelerators – from the University of Oslo and CERN. You can find
a list of my academic work, and publications I've been involved in, on the [Publications](/publications/) page. I currently work as
a Senior Engineer at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, where I mostly work with computer simulations, High Performance
Computing and Machine Learning.

I love to write, and I'm a big Science-Fiction fan. I’ve also had some blogs over the years – mostly writing about LGBT topics – and
I’ve written essays for various publications and blog networks. I've served as a board member for a national LGBTQ+ organisation and
its local branch, and been involved in local politics. These days, I mostly work on various writing projects when I have the time.
As a programmer and writer, I've spent a lot of time developing an open source application for writing novels called
[novelWriter](https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter). You can find more of my programming projects and work projects on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/vkbo) page.

If you wonder what else I've worked with in the past, head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicakbolsen)
profile. I've pretty mush stopped using social media, so the closest I have to a social media account these days is my
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46372019-veronica-olsen) account.
