Hi there, my name is Veronica Berglyd Olsen, and welcome to my personal website!

I grew up on the coast of South-Western Norway, but I have lived both in Sydney, Australia and on the French side of the Geneva valley on the Swiss-French border for several years of my life.
I currently live in Oslo, Norway.

I’m a physicist by education, with a Ph.D. in Plasma Wakefield Accelerators from the University of Oslo and CERN.
You can see some about my academic work on the [Publications](/publications/) page.
I currently work as a Senior Engineer at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, where I mostly work with computer simulations, High Performance Computing and Machine Learning.

I also love to write, and I'm a big Science-Fiction fan.
I’ve had numerous blogs over the years, and I’ve written essays for various publications and blog networks.
These days I mostly work on my own novel projects.
I'm often working on an open source application for writing novels called [novelWriter](https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter).
You can find a lot of my other programming work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/vkbo) page.

If you wonder what else I've worked with in the past, head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicakbolsen) profile.
I've mostly stopped using social media, but you can still find me on Twitter as [DrBerglyd](https://twitter.com/DrBerglyd).
